# About

I'm a Full Stack Developer, entrepreneur, nerd. I graduated [CS](http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/) from [Middle East Technical University](http://www.metu.edu.tr/). I like learning almost everything probably because I'm a nerd.

[Rick and Morty](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty/) is the awesomest thing I've ever watched. I also love watching animes. They are really weird and fasinating.

I love  playing competitive computer games and board games. I was a semi-pro League of Legends players. Some of my achievements are:

* League of Legends EU West Server - Diamond League (Top %0.1)
* League of Legends Turkey Server - Challenger League (Top 50)
* League of Legends – Riot Turkey - 2013 Winter 5v5 team tournement 4th place
* League of Legends – Riot Turkey - 2013 Spring 5v5 team tournement 4th place
* Hearthstone - EU Server - Legend (Top 200)
* Tetrisbattle - Grandmaster League (Top %0.1)
* Age of Empires II - Top 1000
